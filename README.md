# 2023-Elections-Delcared-Profession-Analysis
Welcome to the "2023-Elections-Delcared-Profession-Analysis" project, focused on the analysis of candidates running for the 2023 parliamentary elections in Poland.

## Overview

In this project, I've conducted an analysis of the candidates running for seats in the Sejm and Senate for the 2023 elections in Poland based on their declared profession. My goal is to provide insights into the profiles of these candidates and their declarations. I found some interesting facts that I would like to share with you.

## Key Findings

- Out of the 321 candidates representing the Tanajno party, a staggering 313 of them identify as "business managers." or "entroponour".
- Two out of 12 current Konfederacja MP are declaring "MP" as their only profession
- Number of candidates declaring their profession as "economist" is closely spread across all major electoral lists except for Konfederacja and (in lesser degree) Lewica
- Amongst major committees Kofederacja has over 40% of candidates delcaring their profession as "entroponour" (or related).
